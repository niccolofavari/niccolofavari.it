## The Challenge: Mastering the Dovetail

The dovetail joint. For many aspiring woodworkers, it's a benchmark of skill, a beautiful and strong way to join two pieces of wood. I've admired them from afar, and now it's time to dive in and try to make one myself. This diary will chronicle my attempt â€“ the tools, the techniques, the inevitable mistakes, and any small victories along the way.

### Step 1: Gathering Tools and Materials (Date: 2025-06-17)

Before any sawdust flies, preparation is key. I've gathered:
- A couple of pieces of scrap pine (softwood, good for practicing)
- A dovetail saw (or a fine-toothed tenon saw)
- Marking gauge
- Marking knife
- Chisels (sharpened!)
- Mallet
- Coping saw
- Patience (lots of it)

My plan is to start with a simple through dovetail on two small boards.

*(This section would be updated with photos and progress notes as the project develops. Subsequent updates could be added as new H3 sections with dates, or as separate `project-update` files linked to this main showcase if the project becomes very long.)*

Wish me luck!
