## The Making Of: This Website (with an AI Co-Pilot)

Welcome to a slightly meta post! This is where I'll document the journey of creating this very website. It's an experiment in using [Astro](https://astro.build) for the framework, [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for content, and perhaps most interestingly, leveraging an AI coding assistant, [Cline](https://cline.bot), for significant parts of the development process.

### Initial Setup and Planning
The first steps involved defining the project's philosophy, technology stack, and content strategy. This was a collaborative process with Cline, resulting in a set of `.clinerules` that guide the AI's actions.

### Generating Content Structures
With the rules in place, Cline helped generate the initial batch of sample content files (like this one!), including setting up the directory structure for English and Italian versions and populating frontmatter.

### Future Steps: Design, Components, and Deployment
The journey is ongoing. Next steps include:
-   Implementing the visual design with Tailwind CSS.
-   Developing custom Astro and MDX components.
-   Setting up i18n (internationalization) for English and Italian.
-   Deploying the site.

This learning log will be updated as the site evolves.
