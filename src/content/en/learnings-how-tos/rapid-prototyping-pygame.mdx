## From Idea to Playable in Hours: Micro-Games with Pygame

Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games, is a fantastic tool for rapid prototyping and creating small, fun 2D games. Its simplicity allows you to get ideas off the ground quickly. This tutorial will cover the basics to get you started.

### Setting Up Your Pygame Environment
First, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
```bash
pip install pygame
```
*(Placeholder for basic Pygame window setup, game loop, and event handling)*

### Drawing Shapes and Images
Learn how to draw basic shapes and load images (sprites).
*(Placeholder for `pygame.draw` functions and `pygame.image.load`)*

### Simple Player Movement
Let's make a character move around the screen.

### Example: A Basic "Catch the Falling Objects" Game
We'll put these concepts together to create a very simple game.
