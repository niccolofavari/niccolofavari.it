## The Ultimate Retro Vibe: Raspberry Pi on a CRT

For many retro gaming enthusiasts, playing classic games on a modern LCD screen just doesn't feel right. The sharp pixels and lack of scanlines can't replicate the authentic experience of a CRT television. This guide will walk you through connecting a Raspberry Pi to a CRT for that perfect retro emulation setup.

### Why a CRT?
The magic of scanlines, the slight blur, the warm glow â€“ CRTs offer a visual experience that's intrinsically linked to classic games.
