## Code Your Own Beats with Sonic Pi

Sonic Pi is a fantastic open-source programming environment designed for creating new sounds with code, especially in a live coding context. It's built on Ruby and is surprisingly accessible, even for those new to programming or music theory. Let's explore how to make some noise!

### Getting Started: Your First Sounds
The `play` command is your entry point.
```ruby
play 70
sleep 1
play 75
sleep 0.5
play 72
```
*(Placeholder for explaining MIDI notes, sleep, and basic sequencing)*

### Loops and Rhythms
Creating repeating patterns is easy with `live_loop`.
*(Placeholder for `live_loop` examples and creating simple drum patterns)*

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Sonic Pi offers synths, samples, effects, and much more.
