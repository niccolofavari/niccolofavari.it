## Embarking on the Calisthenics Path

For a while now, I've been drawn to the idea of calisthenics â€“ the art of using one's own bodyweight for strength training. It feels like a natural, holistic way to build functional fitness. This log will track my progress, starting from the very beginning.

### Month 1 Goals (June 2025):
-   Establish a consistent workout routine (3-4 times a week).
-   Focus on proper form for foundational exercises:
    -   Push-ups (and variations like incline push-ups)
    -   Rows (using a low bar or rings)
    -   Squats
    -   Planks
-   Improve core strength.
-   Listen to my body and avoid injury.

### Week 1-2: The Humble Beginnings

The first couple of weeks were all about getting used to the movements and finding my baseline. Push-ups were harder than I remembered! I started with incline push-ups to build up strength. Rows felt awkward at first, but I'm slowly getting the hang of engaging my back muscles.

**Key Learnings:**
-   Consistency is more important than intensity at this stage.
-   Warm-ups and cool-downs are non-negotiable.
-   Even small improvements feel like big wins.

### Week 3-4: Seeing Small Changes

By the end of the month, I started noticing some changes. I could do a few more reps of each exercise, and my form felt a bit more stable. The biggest challenge was maintaining motivation on days when I felt tired or uninspired, but pushing through those moments was rewarding.

**Challenges Faced:**
-   Slight wrist discomfort during push-ups (working on hand placement).
-   Finding the right height for rows.

*(This log will continue with more details on specific workouts, reps/sets, challenges, and achievements in the coming months.)*
