          Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Nick, a backend developer with a wide range of passions that I explore and document here.

          This site serves as my digital garden â€“ a place to cultivate thoughts, share projects, and log my learnings in areas like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technology (software development, game development, hardware tinkering)</li>
          <li>Creative Pursuits (music making, photography, woodworking)</li>
          <li>Retro Gaming</li>
          <li>Physical Wellness (calisthenics)</li>
          <li>Philosophy and explorations of consciousness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Feel free to browse around. Content here is in various stages of "growth," from fleeting "seedling" ideas to more "evergreen" pieces.
