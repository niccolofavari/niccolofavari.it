# Core Philosophy & Approach

- **Open-Source Digital Garden**: The project and its content are intended to be open source, evolving publicly like a digital garden. This encourages transparency, sharing, and community learning.
- **Craftsmanship & Experimentation**: Embrace the process of building. This personal website is a space for meticulous craftsmanship and for experimenting with web technologies and creative ideas, even if it leads to "overengineering" for a good cause.
- **Living Content & Growth Stages**: Content is not static.
    - **Seedling**: Initial ideas, brief notes, outlines, or very rough drafts. Content at this stage is nascent and requires significant development.
    - **Budding**: In-progress content. These are pieces that are actively being developed, have some structure, but are not yet complete or fully polished.
    - **Evergreen**: Mature, comprehensive, and relatively stable pieces. While they can still be updated, they represent a more finalized state of thought or exploration on a topic.
    - The goal is to allow ideas to grow and mature in public, acknowledging that not everything will be finished immediately.
