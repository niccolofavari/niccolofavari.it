# Design & Typography

- **Font Selection**:
    - Choose a primary font for headers (e.g., a distinctive serif or display font).
    - Choose a secondary font for body text (e.g., a readable serif or sans-serif).
    - Select a supporting sans-serif font for UI elements, captions, or other accents.
- **Fluid Type Scale**:
    - Implement a fluid typography system (e.g., using principles from Utopia.fyi or similar tools) to ensure text scales smoothly across different screen sizes.
    - Define minimum and maximum font sizes and viewport widths for the scaling.
- **Visual Aesthetic**:
    - Aim for a clean, minimalist, and intentional design.
    - Prioritize readability and a good user experience.
    - Ensure sufficient color contrast for accessibility.
    - The design should complement and enhance the content, not distract from it.
- **Layout**:
    - Use a consistent layout structure across pages.
    - Employ whitespace effectively to improve readability and visual hierarchy.
